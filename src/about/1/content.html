SK Putrajaya Precinct 9 (1), (formerly known as SK Putrajaya 2) is one of the earliest schools in Putrajaya and one of the Smart Schools in Malaysia and was recognized as a Cluster School in 2009.
Construction of the school began in mid -1998 and was fully completed for use on 17th January 2002, and was known as Sekolah Kebangsaan Putrajaya 2.
The honor as the first Headmaster was given to Mr. Sukimin Bin Juki (my father) who took office on 24 December 1999.

One of the best memories I could recall back from primary school was being part of the dance team.
At such a young age, we were exposed to so many opportunities to perform thanks to our supervising teachers.
The most memorable one would be performing for an event nearby the majestic Putrajaya Mosque alongside Raihan (yes, the Nasyid group).
Funnily we were performing a cheer act instead of the usual traditional dance number at the event attended by Raihan.
It would probably make more sense if I could somehow recall what the event was about but it was over 15years ago.

I'd write more about my primary school days but it really is a very distant memory and I am much older now (sadly).
