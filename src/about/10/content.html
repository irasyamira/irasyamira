<h3>Cats</h3>
What is there to say? I currently live with my two cats, Mew and Epsilon. Both adopted in 2014 from the same litter. Not to be hyperbolic but they are truly my life.
<h3>Basketball/Netball</h3>
I started playing netball since I was in primary school and basketball during college. I used to enter friendly competitions when the opportunity is present up until my undergrad days. I admittedly don't play these sports as much as I'd love too these days since it is a group sport which makes it harder to make impromptu games happen.
<h3>Swimming</h3>
I recently picked up swimming again since I moved to a place with access to a pool. As a child I enjoyed swimming a lot and it was one of the activities my family and I did a lot growing up.
<h3>Music</h3>
I listen to all sorts of music - The 1975, Zedd, Girls Generation, Kygo, Avicii.
<h3>Stargazing</h3>
Balik Pulau.
