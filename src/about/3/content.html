I was blessed to be part of Eldaterra, my 0711 sisters whom I grew up with for five years. Five years is a pretty long time to live together. We practically saw each other grow in many different ways and shared many great memories including the mundane day-to-day tasks like waking up so early just to get a turn at the shower, prayers at the surau, eating meals, to more eventful days like organizing ceremonies, sports day, and celebratory dinners. Although those days may feel like a distant memory, revisiting them has never felt any different - it is always a nice warm feeling.

Sharing the pressure of doing well academically with my Eldaterra sisters was a pleasure above all. The expectations were crazy high for every major exam, we would stay up so late burning the midnight oil and then falling asleep in class (which now that I think about it is very counter-productive?). But those late nights seeing people walking through the corridors reading the textbook to avoid falling asleep, walking down to the ground floor to get hot water and make instant noodle, brewing instant coffee at midnight to pull an all-nighter has got to be worth the pressure we faced. It's often the little moments that we overlook in the present, but think about a lot after the moment has long passed.

One of the most random yet very memorable experience of mine from high school has got to be being part of the Police Cadet. I joined the organization simply because everything else (Pandu Puteri, Puteri Islam etc.) was at full capacity at the time. So I just signed up for it and regretted it at first because training was rigorous and I was not up for it. Forward to many years later and many camps/competitions later, I was a Sergeant Major (Sarjan Mejar) and the president of the Police Cadet Club of Sekolah Seri Puteri lol. It's truly one of the best memories from my high school years so I'm glad it turned out the way it did.

It was truly and honour to have been exposed to so many invaluable experiences in a such prestigious school. I owe a lot of my personal growth to the wonderful people I have crossed paths with in SSP, from my fellow Eldaterra sisters, my junior and senior friends, teachers and staffs.
