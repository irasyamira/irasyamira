Following my Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) results, I was lucky enough to be accepted in one of the highest ranking universities in the world, Universiti Malaya (UM) of Malaysia.
Albeit only spending a month in the university, the whole experience still managed to leave an impression on me.
<br>
<br>
As a student from a boarding school during my secondary education years, for the first few weeks I recall feeling shocked with the freedom I had.
We were free to leave campus after class? We could go to Mid-Valley Megamall at any time? That's crazy! The classes were intense ngl - every lesson covers like a quarter of the textbooks I feel.
If I blanked out in class for a second I'd probably miss a whole section of the syllabus (may or may not be an exaggeration).
<br>
<br>
Orientation was intense, just like any other universities I assume.
I remember thinking to myself "Why the hell am I, a full-grown (young) adult, forced to run with an umbrella to the chancellery for an ice-breaking session conducted by people who are just a few years older than me?".
I still don't know why. And I suffered a lot because ice-breaking session are always so painful for me personally. Which reminds me of my next point...
<br>
<br>
I also recall having a hard time making friends in class because everyone I knew from high school were in the Life Sciences stream (Sains Hayat) and I was the only one in Physical Sciences (Sains Fizikal).
At that time I discovered that I was actually a very shy person because I had zero guts to approach anyone.
Luckily, there were a few people who would regularly sit beside me in class and started conversations.
So upon leaving UM for KMB after accepting the MARA scholarship, I was determined to break out of my bubble and work on being comfortable in making new friends once I start my new journey in KMB.
