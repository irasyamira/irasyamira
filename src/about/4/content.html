Universiti Malaya, or UM, Malaysia's oldest university, is situated on a 922 acre (373.12 hectare) campus in the southwest of Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia. It was founded on 28 September 1905 in Singapore as the King Edward VII College of Medicine and on 8th October 1949, it became the University of Malaya with the merger of the King Edward VII College of Medicine and Raffles College (founded in 1928). The University of Malaya derives its name from the term 'Malaya' as the country was then known. The Carr-Saunders Commission on University Education in Malaya, which recommended the setting up of the university, noted in its Report in 1948: "The University of Malaya would provide for the first time a common centre where varieties of race, religion and economic interest could mingle in joint endeavour ... For a University of Malaya must inevitably realise that it is a university for Malaya."

Following my Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia (SPM) results, I was lucky enough to be accepted in one of the highest ranking universities in the world, Universiti Malaya of Malaysia. Albeit only spending a month in the university, the whole experience still left an impression on me.

As a student from a boarding school during my secondary education, for the first few weeks I recall feeling shocked with the freedom I had. We were free to leave campus after class? We could go to Mid-Valley Megamall at any time? That's crazy! The classes were intense ngl - every lesson covers like a quarter of the textbooks I feel. If I blanked out in class for a second I'd probably miss a whole section of the syllabus (may or may not be an exaggeration).

Orientation was intense, just like any other universities I assume. I remember thinking to myself "Why the hell am I, a full-grown (young) adult, forced to run with an umbrella to the chancellery for an ice-breaking session conducted by people who are just a few years older than me?". I still don't know why. And I suffered a lot because ice-breaking session are always so painful for me personally. Which reminds me of my next point...

I also recall having a hard time making friends in class because everyone I knew from high school were in the Life Sciences stream (Sains Hayat) and I was the only one in Physical Sciences (Sains Fizikal). At that time I discovered that I was actually a very shy person because I had zero guts to approach anyone. Luckily, there were a few people who would regularly sit beside me in class and started conversations. So upon leaving UM for KMB after accepting the MARA scholarship, I was determined to break out of my bubble and work on being comfortable in making new friends once I started my new journey in KMB.
