Kolej MARA Banting (KMB) is an International Baccalaureate (IB) World School since October 1990.
I was offered a spot in KMB shortly after I received my MARA scholarship offer in June 2012.
Having spent a month in Universiti Malaya (UM) prior to my enrollment in KMB, I had a tough time adjusting to the culture as it was very different.
The infamous IB diploma syllabus lived up to its horror stories, it was indeed tough to juggle the subjects and maintain sanity to put it simply.
But ultimately the whole 2-year in KMB really changed my perspective on a lot of things in a good way.

The IB diploma culture of risk-taking is something I practice until this day in both my professional and personal life.
We were strongly taught to push ourselves and take calculated risks which is something I personally struggle with especially in classroom settings.
I have always been accustomed to exercising my knowledge in assigments and exams with the thought that there is an answer scheme that I need to match to.
When in reality, life does not work that way.
In fact we always have to work the other way round - we just gotta exercise our knowledge, get different outputs that may or may not be correct, because no one really knows.
Life is just a continuous path-finding process :)
