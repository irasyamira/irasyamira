Kolej MARA Banting (KMB) is an International Baccalaureate World School since October 1990. Its history began in 1985 when the GCE A-Level programme was introduced in MARA Junior Science College Seremban (MRSM Seremban, now known as Kolej MARA Seremban). To diversify the number of universities that students can apply to, in 1991 the college introduced a new pre-university programme: the IB Diploma Programme. (The IB programme is recognised for admission into universities around the world.) The college has 94 lecturers with 41 support staff running day-to-day activities. Since May 2003, MARA College Banting has become a full-fledged 'IB World School'. Previously, MARA College Banting offered other pre-university programmes such as GCE A-Level and Matriculation but now only the IB programme.

I entered KMB shortly after I received my MARA scholarship offer in June 2012. Having spent a month in Universiti Malaya (UM) prior to my enrollment to KMB, I had a tough time adjusting to the culture as it was very different. The infamous IB syllabus lived up to its horror stories, it was indeed tough to juggle the subjects and maintain sanity haha. But ultimately the whole 2-year in KMB really changed my perspective on a lot of things in a good way.

The culture of risk-taking is something I practice until this day in both my professional and personal life. We were strongly taught to push ourselves and take calculated risks, break the norm of being on the receiving end in a discussion and start speaking up.

Although it was a tough two-year altogether, I would do it all over again. I have made some life-long friends here who shares the best of values and continuously motivates me in becoming a better person.
