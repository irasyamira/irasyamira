As a Computer Systems Engineering student, my undergraduate studies was focused on embedded systems, hardware (i.e. FPGAs, microcontrollers) programming and software development.
I started off my journey with my very first programming language, C as a first year engineering student in 2015.
Since then, I was slowly exposed to more programming languages such as Python, Java and C++ through various types of projects.
<br>
<u><h5>Communication Difficulties</h5></u>
The whole studying experience in New Zealand was challenging despite being some of the best years in my life.
During my very first year doing general engineering (UoA engineering degree requires one year of general engineering before specializing for the remaining three years), I struggled a lot with getting my point across when communicating.
I personally have never thought communication would be a problem as I have always spoken English comfortably.
However, I learned that being able to speak fluent English as a second language does not reflect one's ability to convey information precisely in the language.
Often times when talking to my Malay-speaking friends, I could always code-switch (and I do that a lot) to get my point across.
So communicating with native speakers was really challenging for me, often times it can get frustrating not being able to encapsulate what I truly mean.
So I took this whole experience as a point to mingle around with native-speakers and pushed myself to make tougher choices moving forward.
<br>
<u><h5>Computer Systems Engineering</h5></u>
At the end of my first year in 2015, we were required to provide three options for our specialization.
I had my heart set on Software Engineering as I really enjoyed the programming classes throughout the first year plus I had some Malaysian seniors who have completed Software Engineering in UoA (although not that many) so it felt like a safe bet - I could just hit them up if I was stuck.
I put Computer Systems Engineering as my second choice because the description sounds pretty close to Software Engineering at the time, and Engineering Science as my third (I still don't know what Engineering Science is to this day).

Of course knowing my luck, I did not make it into my first choice and got into Computer Systems Engineering instead.
I honestly did not know anything about it as no Malaysian student to my knowledge has ever taken it (which was later confirmed by my lecturer who approached me personally and asked me why I took the course since he has never seen a Malaysian in his class throughout his years there lol).
So naturally I freaked out but told myself ok so this is the universe telling me to leave my comfort zone and stop relying on safety nets (i.e. having Malaysian friends in the same course for moral support and assignments help of course).
<br>
<br>
Frankly I struggled A LOT throughout the remaining three years but it was 100% worth it, I'd happily do it all over again.
I completed so many great programming/coding projects such as the Maze-solving robot, Peer-to-peer Messaging WebApp, Java-based ping-pong game and a tank-shooting game using an FPGA.
Through the group projects I had, I met some of the best people and made plenty of friends whom I still talk to till this day.
I am forever grateful I was denied my comfortable choice and got placed in Computer Systems Engineering instead.
As dramatic as it sounds, my undergraduate life has forced me to make so many tough decisions and has put me into so many uncomfortable situations which has actually made me so much braver in making tough decisions and taking risks in life.
