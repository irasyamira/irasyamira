Throughout my internship, I was responsible in supporting on-going digital projects, focusing on UI/UX development.
This includes conducting sprints, developing low/high fidelity sketches, wireframing and content population.
Despite the internship period being very short, I truly enjoyed my time there.
Often times we would grind to the wee hours to finish our deliverables.
Then, we would reward our hard work accordingly.
We would find every excuse to hold a small gathering from time-to-time. Christmas? Secret Santa. Someone departing? Pool party. Friday? Sushi time.
It made communication so much easier and helped in professional settings as everyone is comfortable to speak to each other.
It was my very first professional working experience and I have met some of the best people who has shared all kinds of wisdom.
