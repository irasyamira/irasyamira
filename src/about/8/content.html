Intel Altera was originally known as Altera Corporation, a company that specialized in designing and manufacturing programmable logic devices (PLDs), including Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Complex Programmable Logic Devices (CPLDs), and related software and tools.
<br>
<br>
I joined the company in April 2019 as a Graduate Trainee and worked alongside senior engineers as a part of the "buddy" program to help new engineers assimilate into their roles.
Throughout my tenure, I was involved in numerous critical product rollout and debug support, some notable ones being Intel Agilex and Intel Arria. I was also part of the committee for numerous company events as an effort
to expand my network and developing my soft skills.
<br>
<br>
As a Product Development Engineer, I have the responsibility to ensure every FPGA is up to specifications through specially curated test contents, as well as replicating and debugging customer issues.
On a day-to-day basis, if I am not debugging a faulty unit, I focus on producing, improving and automating test contents.

<br>
Being a part of such a big company has given me a front-seat experience to see the works behind such a large-scale production while reaping as much learning as I can while being in a giant name in the silicon industry.
