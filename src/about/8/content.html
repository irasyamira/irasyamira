Intel Programmable Solutions Group (PSG) was formed from the acquisition of Altera. The organization works with specifically Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).
<br>
<br>
I joined the company in April 2019 as a Graduate Trainee and worked alongside senior engineers as a part of the "buddy" program to help new engineers assimilate into their roles.
Since then, I have been involved in numerous critical projects and participated in multiple event committee for company events.
<br>
<br>
As a Product Development Engineer, I have the responsibility to ensure every FPGA is up to specifications through specially curated test contents, as well as handling customer returns.
On a day-to-day basis, if I am not debugging a faulty unit, I focus on producing, improving and automating test contents.

Being a part of such a big company has given me a front-seat experience to see the works behind such a large-scale production.
It is such a fast-paced process between milestones throughout a product's lifecycle.
It was apparent that each and every one of the employee plays an important role in keeping the success of the company in check.
The possibilites for career growth is endless in Intel, and there is always something new to learn with every passing day.
