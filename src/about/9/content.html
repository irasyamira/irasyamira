Hi! I am Ira Syamira Sukimin. Most of you may know me as "Ira" (pronounced as ee-rah) but if we go way back to primary school, I am most likely "Syam" to you (which is also the name my family calls me).
<br>
<br>
I have pretty much lived most of my life away from my family.
I went straight to boarding school at the age of 13.
Entered college right after, and then flew to New Zealand for my undergraduate studies.
Soon after I returned from New Zealand, Alhamdulillah, I landed my current job at Intel Penang which forces me to again, live far away from my family.
Nevertheless, they have been endlessly supportive of me and my decisions.
Whatever I pursued, they cheered on for me.
<h3>Interests</h3>
<h7>Cats</h7>
What's not to love about cats? They're fluffy, warm, cuddly and soft.
I currently live with my two tabby cats, Mew and Epsilon.
Both adopted in 2014 when they were less than a month old.
Throughout the long period of covid quarantine for the past two years, they both have kept me sane and kept me company every single day.
They've cuddled me on sad days, days that I am too sick to function, happy days, they have seen it all!
<br>
<br>
<h7>Basketball/Netball</h7>
I started playing netball since I was in primary school and basketball during college.
I used to enter friendly competitions when the opportunities are present up until my undergrad days.
I admittedly don't play these sports as much as I'd love too these days since it is a group sport which makes it harder to make impromptu games happen.
But I do try to shoot some hoops by myself whenever I can these days.
<br>
<br>
<h7>Swimming</h7>
I recently picked up swimming again since I moved to a place with access to a pool.
As a child, I enjoyed swimming a lot and it was one of the activities my family and I did a lot growing up.
<br>
<br>
<h7>Music</h7>
I listen to all sorts of music and follow a wide array of artists - The 1975, Zedd, Girls Generation, Kygo, Avicii, Fallout Boy, Paramore, Halsey.
