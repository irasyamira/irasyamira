Hi! I am Ira Syamira Sukimin. Most of you may know me as "Ira" (pronounced as ee-rah) but if we go way back to primary school, I am most likely "Syam" to you (which is also the name my family calls me).
<br>
<br>
I have pretty much lived most of my life away from my family.
I went straight to boarding school at the age of 13.
Entered college right after, and then flew to New Zealand for my undergraduate studies.
Soon after I returned from New Zealand, Alhamdulillah, I landed my current job at Intel Penang which forces me to again, live far away from my family.
Nevertheless, they have been endlessly supportive of me and my decisions.
Whatever I pursued, they cheered on for me.
<br>
<br>
I am a highly-introverted person so naturally I am a homebody. I don't mind being social once in a while when the situation demands for it, but of course at the end of every day all I want to do is just sit quietly by myself and unwind.
I do push myself to step out of my comfort-zone once in a while and mingle with people to pursue my interests and grow as a person both in my personal and professional life.
<br>
<br>
I am a firm believer that there is something to learn from everything and everyone in the world if we have the right mindset, but in order to do so one must first leave the house :D
<h3>Interests</h3>
<h5>Cats</h5>
What's not to love about cats? They're fluffy, warm, cuddly and soft.
I currently live with my two tabby cats, Mew and Epsilon.
Both adopted in 2014 when they were less than a month old.
Throughout the long period of covid quarantine for the past two years, they both have kept me sane and kept me company every single day.
They've cuddled me on sad days, days that I am too sick to function, happy days, they have seen it all!
<br>
<br>
<h5>Movies/TV Series</h5>
I generally enjoy comedy, sci-fi, horror, dystopian-themed shows and movies. I lean more towards series/shows over movies since I enjoy watching media at the comfort of my own home so I rarely go to the cinemas to catch the latest movies.<br>
<br>
<b>Favourites: </b>Modern Family, The IT Crowd, Brooklyn 99,
The Haunting of Hill House, The Hunger Games, Alice in Borderland.
<br>
<b>Recently watched: </b>Russian Doll (Season 2), Stranger Things (Season 4)
<br>
<br>
<h5>Basketball/Netball</h5>
I started playing netball since I was in primary school and basketball during college.
I used to enter friendly competitions when the opportunities are present up until my undergrad days.
I admittedly don't play these sports as much as I'd love too these days since it is a group sport which makes it harder to make impromptu games happen.
But I do try to shoot some hoops by myself whenever I can these days.
<br>
<br>
<h5>Swimming</h5>
I recently picked up swimming again since I moved to a place with access to a pool.
As a child, I enjoyed swimming a lot and it was one of the activities my family and I did a lot growing up.
<br>
<br>
<h5>Music</h5>
I listen to all sorts of music and follow a wide array of artists - The 1975, Zedd, Girls Generation, Kygo, Avicii, Fallout Boy, Paramore, Halsey.
