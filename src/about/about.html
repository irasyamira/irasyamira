                Hi! I am Ira Syamira Sukimin. Most of you may know me as "Ira" (pronounced as ee-rah) but if we go way back to primary school, I am most likely "Syam" to you (which is what my family calls me).
                <br>
                <br>
                I have pretty much lived most of my life away from my family. I went straight to boarding school at the age of 13. Entered college right after, and then flew to New Zealand for my undergraduate studies.
                <br>
                <br>
                Soon after I returned from New Zealand, Alhamdulillah, I landed my current job at Intel Penang which forces me to again, live far away from my family. Nevertheless, they have been endlessly supportive of me and my decisions. Whatever I pursued, they cheered on for me.
                <br>
                <br>
                While I am still in my early years of my career life, I am continuously taking on side projects in my free time to explore my interests and sharpen my skills.
                Like most developers, I too am guilty of having countless of Github repositories with the first commit being the last one in a very long time. But I am proud I did finish this website!

                Kolej MARA Banting (KMB) is an International Baccalaureate World School since October 1990. Its history began in 1985 when the GCE A-Level programme was introduced in MARA Junior Science College Seremban (MRSM Seremban, now known as Kolej MARA Seremban). To diversify the number of universities that students can apply to, in 1991 the college introduced a new pre-university programme: the IB Diploma Programme. (The IB programme is recognised for admission into universities around the world.) The college has 94 lecturers with 41 support staff running day-to-day activities. Since May 2003, MARA College Banting has become a full-fledged 'IB World School'. Previously, MARA College Banting offered other pre-university programmes such as GCE A-Level and Matriculation but now only the IB programme.

                Universiti Malaya, or UM, Malaysia's oldest university, is situated on a 922 acre (373.12 hectare) campus in the southwest of Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia. It was founded on 28 September 1905 in Singapore as the King Edward VII College of Medicine and  on 8th October 1949, it became the University of Malaya with  the merger of the King Edward VII College of Medicine and Raffles College (founded in 1928). The University of Malaya derives its name from the term 'Malaya' as the country was then known. The Carr-Saunders Commission on University Education in Malaya, which recommended the setting up of the university, noted in its Report in 1948: "The University of Malaya would provide for the first time a common centre where varieties of race, religion and economic interest could mingle in joint endeavour ... For a University of Malaya must inevitably realise that it is a university for Malaya."
