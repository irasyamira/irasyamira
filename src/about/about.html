                Hi! I am Ira Syamira Sukimin. Most of you may know me as "Ira" (pronounced as ee-rah) but if we go way back to primary school, I am most likely "Syam" to you (which is what my family calls me).
                <br>
                <br>
                I have pretty much lived most of my life away from my family. I went straight to boarding school at the age of 13. Entered college right after, and then flew to New Zealand for my undergraduate studies.
                <br>
                <br>
                Soon after I returned from New Zealand, Alhamdulillah, I landed my current job at Intel Penang which forces me to again, live far away from my family. Nevertheless, they have been endlessly supportive of me and my decisions. Whatever I pursued, they cheered on for me.
                <br>
                <br>
                While I am still in my early years of my career life, I am continuously taking on side projects in my free time to explore my interests and sharpen my skills.
                Like most developers, I too am guilty of having countless of Github repositories with the first commit being the last one in a very long time. But I am proud I did finish this website!

                Intel Programmable Solutions Group (PSG) was formed from the acquisition of Altera. The organization works with specifically Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).
                As a Product Development Engineer, I have the responsibility to ensure every FPGA is up to specifications through specially curated test contents, as well as handling customer returns.
                On a day-to-day basis, if I am not debugging a faulty unit, I focus on producing, improving and automating test contents.

                Throughout my internship, I was responsible in supporting on-going digital projects, focusing on UI/UX. This includes producing the rough sketches, stringing them together (i forgot the term) and population contents.

                As a Computer Systems Engineering student, my undergrad was focused on embedded systems, hardware (i.e. FPGAs, microcontrollers) programming and software development.
                I started off my journey with my very first programming language C as a first year engineering student.
                Since then, I was slowly exposed to more high level languages such as Python, Java and C++ through various types of projects.
