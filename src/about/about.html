Hi! I am Ira Syamira Sukimin. Most of you may know me as "Ira" (pronounced as ee-rah) but if we go way back to primary school, I am most likely "Syam" to you (which is what my family calls me).

While I am still in my early years of my career life, I am continuously taking on side projects in my free time to explore my interests and sharpen my skills.
Like most developers, I too am guilty of having countless of Github repositories with the first commit being the last one in a very long time. But I am proud I did finish this website!
