Hi! I am Ira Syamira Sukimin. Most of you may know me as "Ira" (pronounced as ee-rah) but if we go way back to primary school, I am most likely "Syam" to you (which is what my family calls me).
<br>
<br>
I have pretty much lived most of my life away from my family. I went straight to boarding school at the age of 13. Entered college right after, and then flew to New Zealand for my undergraduate studies.
<br>
<br>
Soon after I returned from New Zealand, Alhamdulillah, I landed my current job at Intel Penang which forces me to again, live far away from my family. Nevertheless, they have been endlessly supportive of me and my decisions. Whatever I pursued, they cheered on for me.
<br>
<br>
While I am still in my early years of my career life, I am continuously taking on side projects in my free time to explore my interests and sharpen my skills.
Like most developers, I too am guilty of having countless of Github repositories with the first commit being the last one in a very long time. But I am proud I did finish this website!
