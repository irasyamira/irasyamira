<h3>Hello ૮ ˶ᵔ ᵕ ᵔ˶ ა</h3>
Welcome to Ira Syamira's personal website!
<br>
<br>
I kickstarted this website as an effort to improve my webdev skills.
My first web app development project was during undergrad using Python and CherryPy in 2017 which mainly focuses on back-end development.
Since then, I developed some interest to further explore this area of knowledge as a side project.
I admitedly don't have the best front-end design ideas and skills but I try to make it work and keep it simple.
As for the content, I intend to archive bits of both my personal and professional experiences here from time-to-time.
