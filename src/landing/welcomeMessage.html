Welcome to my personal website! I am Ira Syamira Sukimin. Most of you may know me as "Ira" (pronounced as ee-rah) but if we go way back to primary school, I am most likely "Syam" to you (which is what my family calls me).
I intend to archive bits of both my personal and professional experiences here from time-to-time.
