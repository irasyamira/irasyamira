Throughout my internship, I was responsible in supporting on-going digital projects, focusing on UI/UX. This includes conducting sprints, developing low/high fidelity sketches, wireframing and content population. Despite the internship period being very short, I truly enjoyed my time there. It was my very first professional working experience and I met the best of people who has shared all kinds of wisdom.

The working culture was healthy - work hard and play hard would be the best way to put it. Often times we would grind to the wee hours to finish our deliverables. Then, we would reward our hard work accordingly. We would find every excuse to hold a small gathering from time-to-time. Christmas? Secret Santa. Someone departing? Pool party. Friday? Long lunch break at the sushi place. It made communication so much easier and helped in professional settings as everyone is comfortable to speak to each other.
