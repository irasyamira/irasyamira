I entered KMB shortly after I received my MARA scholarship offer in June 2012. Having spent a month in Universiti Malaya (UM) prior to my enrollment to KMB, I had a tough time adjusting to the culture as it was very different. The infamous IB syllabus lived up to its horror stories, it was indeed tough to juggle the subjects and maintain sanity haha. But ultimately the whole 2-year in KMB really changed my perspective on a lot of things in a good way.

The culture of risk-taking is something I practice until this day in both my professional and personal life. We were strongly taught to push ourselves and take calculated risks, break the norm of being on the receiving end in a discussion and start speaking up.

Although it was a tough two-year altogether, I would do it all over again. I have made some life-long friends here who shares the best of values and continuously motivates me in becoming a better person.
