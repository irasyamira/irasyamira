The "Career Exposure in STEM, Arts & Literature" program was first initiated by Eldaterra's [1] very own Dr Siti Hajar Zuber as a way
to give back to our alma mater, Sekolah Seri Puteri. The aim was to provide exposure on the variety of career paths available post-SPM, as well as the tertiary education pathway
one may pursue if the aim is to land a job within said career/field. The motivation for this comes from our very own personal experiences as SPM students back in 2011 where we were pressured into
making big decisions on our tertiary education paths in order to secure scholarships, while having very little idea on the options available at the time.
As most of the Eldaterra sisters are equipped with ~5years of experience to date in our respective fields, we came to a conclusion that we were in the perfect
position to relay our experiences and takeaways from the choices we have made since 2011 to the sisters of Adorea 1923 [2]. Thanks to the help from the PUTERI Alumni [3], we were able to make this event happen as how we envisioned it.
<br>
<br>
We were segregated into 12 different groups according to our careers and specialisations which consisted of the following (in order of presentation) - <b>
Engineering, Academic and Research, Law, Marketing & Social Media Manager, Medicine, Accounting, Performance and Arts, Architecture, Data Science, Veterinary, Financing and Dentistry.</b>
During the first session, a representative from each group presented a curated overview of their respective industries for up to five minutes.
After back-to-back presentations by six groups (Engineering to Accounting), the Eldateraa particpants then stood by their booths to allow questions by the attending students.
The students roamed freely across all the available booths within this period of time, utilising the time to have all their concerns regarding the industry, job scope and courses addressed.
The first session was then concluded and all attendees took the lunch and prayer break. We managed to catch up with each other over lunch as there were plenty of us who did not see each other since 2011.
Shortly after, the second session was held in a similar manner as the first, dedicated to the six remaining groups (Performance and Arts to Dentistry).
The program was wrapped up by several activited conducted by the PUTERI Alumni sisters on how to recognising one's strengths and how to best tackle scholarship interviews.
<br>
<br>
Overall, we had a really fulfilling experience being able share on the things we wished we knew back then as an SPM student.
It was also a nice trip down memory lane revisiting our teenage years embedded within the walls of the school.
Although many things has changed since then, we still felt very fondly of the place for all the things we have learned throughout the 5-years spent there.
<br>
<br>
We truly wish the best to the sisters of Adorea 1923, may you succeed in whatever path you traverse in the future â™¡
