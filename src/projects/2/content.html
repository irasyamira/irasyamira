COMPSYS 301 Design Project – The Line Following Robot. We have divided this report into three main components; Analogue design, PCB design and the Software design, as these were major sections in the design and implementation of our project. A mix of analogue, digital, and software solutions have been implemented for this project. The report sections have been structured to follow the timeline and the progression of the three main project components. The design considerations were first discussed, followed by the design decisions chosen. In each of the design considerations we have discussed the main factors surrounded the required decisions to make, and possible options that could be chosen. In the design decisions, we touch back on the considerations required and explain the decisions that we made based on how the solutions fit the required functionality. The processes of verification, validation and testing of the analogue solution were further discussed following the first two main sections of the report. These covered the simulation and extensive testing procedures completed on the light sensor circuit. A discussion on the components of the software solution along with testing procedures was then further elaborated. A detailed appendix with relevant figures, schematics, graphs, and measurements has been attached along with the robot's datasheet.

A large part of computer systems engineering consists of sensing external variables, processing that information in an embedded system, and then modifying outputs to complete a task or function. This design project is intended to develop and showcase our skills at designing and implementing such an embedded system, which senses external inputs and utilises actuators to complete required functionality. In the case of our autonomous line following robot, light sensors are used to detect the light intensity of specific areas above the robot – with the main goal of allowing the robot to traverse a maze projected downwards from a mounted computer projector. The project incorporates many fundamental concepts of computer systems engineering such as signal processing, embedded design, and actuator controllers. The light sensor circuits on the robot included a phototransistor, a filtering state, and a gain stage with voltage offset. The microcontroller integrated circuit chip that we used was a PSoC 5, with both hardware and software programmability. We utilised pulse width modulation on the two independently controllable wheels to allow the robot to follow maze lines. We also included many other popular embedded systems features in our project, to ensure that the robot would be able to carry out its functionality as best as possible. These included radio frequency UART receiving for positioning, quadrature output from the motors, and USB UART for debugging. We also designed and implemented a basic PI controller to maintain constant speed and straight-line movement. The project also includes two maze traversal algorithms, DFS and A*, which are used to allow the robot to navigate through a maze and collect food pellets. 
<h5>Design Considerations</h5>
A total of three circuits design were proposed and considered for this project. Their features and functionalities were then evaluated when deciding on the final circuit design which is discussed further in the Analogue Design Decisions section. The first circuit (see Appendix Figure 1) consists of three fundamental circuits which are the sensing circuitry, filtering circuitry and the gain circuitry. The DC offset from the signal is removed by the coupling capacitor in the high pass filter in the filtering circuitry. The high frequency signal is then amplified in the gain stage. The DC offset applied within the gain stage ensures that the output voltage is within the PSoC voltage range. The second circuit (see Appendix Figure 2) proposed consists of two fundamental circuits which are the sensing, filtering and gain circuitries. The AC coupling removes the DC offset from the signal coming from the sensing stage which therefore increases the resolution of the signal measurement. The gain stage introduces a transistor which amplifies the signal. The usage of a transistor is less costly when compared to using an operational amplifier. The third circuit (see Appendix Figure 3) consists of four fundamental circuits which are the sensing, filtering, buffering and the gain circuitries. Low frequencies are filtered out by the high pass filter, ensuring no amplified unwanted signals in the later gain stage. The buffering stage then isolates the output from the first circuitry from the input of the second circuitry. The DC offset applied then shifts the amplified signal to ensure that they are within the PSoC operational voltage. Design Decisions For the final circuit design, the third circuit proposed for the project were chosen as it encapsulates the features that enables the project to meet its specifications and goals Since navigation of the robot is dependent on the light from a projector, it was reasoned that noise would be one of the problems affecting the light sensing circuit. To help reduce it, a high pass filter was introduced with each individual phototransistor to help minimise noise without using any software-based solutions. This allows the cut-off of light with frequencies lower than that of the light projector (120Hz), especially the ambient light at 50Hz. Without these filters, the low frequency signals will be amplified in the amplification stage of the circuit. Resistor and capacitor values also had to be considered to make sure that the corner frequency would limit as much noise as possible without attenuating the frequency from the projected light. A lack of a filter stage would cause inaccurate analogue values when the output signal from the circuit is being fed into the ADC of the PSoC, resulting in the difficulty to differentiate between a wall and a path on the projected map. The buffering circuitry in the proposed circuit provides isolation from the filter stage that has a high output impedance to the amplification stage which has low input impedance level. This ensure maximum energy transfer between two fundamental circuits while preventing the signal transferred to interfere with the desired operation of the whole circuit. This isolated the filtering and amplifying parts of the light sensor circuit from each other.
