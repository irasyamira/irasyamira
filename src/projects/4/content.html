An automated clothing search tool. Provides user with visually similar (color, clothing-type and material) clothing options at different price points on Amazon through the processing of a single image, either captured or uploaded from the gallery by the user. The backend Python program is hosted in the cloud and interacts with a Java front-end.

The Smartfashion mobile application automates the search of visually similar clothing items
using image processing and machine learning.Smartfashion 2.0 continues the success of the initialimplementation of Smartfashion [1] with the addition ofa new feature – fabric detection. This report discusses theimplementation of Smartfashion 2.0 in depth, includingthe motivation behind the need to incorporate fabricdetection into the existing system as well as the resultsobtained from the addition of this feature. Existingmobile applications that also performs automatedclothing search has been compared against the featuresof Smartfashion 2.0. Through this comparison, it hasbeen discovered that none of the existing products hasimplemented both fabric and clothing type detectiontogether due to the contrasting need for a zoomed-ininput image to perform fabric detection and a zoomed-out input image for clothing type detection. Machinelearning models taken into consideration have beenquantitatively analysed before one was selected for theimplementation. The Support Vector Machine (SVM)learning model was selected to perform both clothing-type and fabric detection due to its relatively highaccuracy when split-testing was carried out. After theimplementation has been completed, results from testinghas concluded that both fabric and clothing-typedetection can be performed using the same zoomed-outinput image. The accuracy of this implementation hasbeen quantitatively analysed – both fabric and clothing-type detection resulted in an accuracy of 57.5%.Conclusions derived from the project along with possibleimprovements and refinement are also discussed brieflyin this documentation.
