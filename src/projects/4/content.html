The Smartfashion 2.0 mobile application automates the search of visually similar clothing items using image processing and machine learning. Smartfashion 2.0 continues the success of the initial implementation of Smartfashion from 2017 with the addition of a new feature – fabric detection. The mobile application provides user with visually similar (colour, clothing-type and material) clothing options at different price points on Amazon through the processing of a single image, either captured or uploaded from the gallery by the user. The backend Python program is hosted in the cloud and interacts with a Java front-end.
<h5>Development Process</h5>
Existing mobile applications in the market that also performs automated clothing search have been compared against the features of Smartfashion 2.0. Through this comparison, it has been discovered that none of the existing products has implemented both fabric and clothing type detection together due to the contrasting need for a zoomed-in input image to perform fabric detection and a zoomed-out input image for clothing type detection. Machine learning models taken into consideration have been quantitatively analysed before one was selected for the implementation. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning model was selected to perform both clothing-type and fabric detection due to its relatively high accuracy when split-testing was carried out. After the implementation has been completed, results from testing has concluded that both fabric and clothing-type detection can be performed using the same zoomed-out input image. The accuracy of this implementation has been quantitatively analysed – both fabric and clothing-type detection resulted in an accuracy of 57.5%.

The Smartfashion mobile application has successfully automated the process of visually similar clothes on Amazon using image processing and machine learning. The addition of the new fabric detection feature to the mobile application has narrowed down search results to only the fabric type specified. As a whole, Smartfashion achieves an accuracy of 57.5% in detecting leather when tested with images containing all kinds of fabric. As the machine learning model used were trained to only detect leather and wool, testing was extended to only the identification of either leather or wool. This is to qualitatively measure the feasibility of a continued work on Smartfashion based on the accuracy of the learning model for fabric identification alone. The extended testing resulted in an accuracy of 63.4%. Therefore, future work in adding more fabric types is promising based on the extended testing of leather and wool identification.

The completion of Smartfashion 2.0 has proven that the execution of both fabric and clothing-type detection using a single image is possible. Through detailed testing, several issues impacting the final accuracy of the search results were identified and addressed in the main documentation. This includes the use of lower quality images (i.e. compressed images, images with smaller dimensions), lighting condition in the photos taken as well as training images under ideal conditions (i.e. good contrast, high quality, good lighting) used for the SVM feature generation. As the focus of Smartfashion 2.0 was fabric detection, testing has been extended to only using dataset containing leather and wool images. This is to measure the performance of the new feature, as well as measuring the potential of success in future work relating to the expansion of fabric types able to be identified by the mobile application through machine learning. The following section, Section 2.0, will present in-depth analysis on the results from the extended testing which includes the confusion matrices as well as precision, recall a and F1 score values calculated from the matrices. Possible improvements, refinement and future work to the Smartfashion.
