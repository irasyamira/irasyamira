The smart traffic violation detection system detects whether a vehicle is present within the yellow box of an intersection and then determines the type of violation using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system was implemented using an UP<small>2</small> board and an Intel Movidius stick.
<h5>Project Background</h5>
The increasing number of private vehicles on the road nowadays directly impacts the time spent in traffic congestion when commuting. There are numerous of obvious solutions that can help mitigate traffic congestion such as increasing number of lanes, building overpass roads and directly decreasing number of private vehicles on the road by providing better public transportation. However, these solutions requires a long time to execute and take effect, as well as requiring a large amount of financial investment.
<br><br>
Therefore, this system makes use of the already existing infrastructures to their absolute potential. As a lot of traffic congestions occur due to the successive number of intersections controlled by traffic lights, the best possible way to tackle this issue is to smoothen traffic flow at every intersection, specifically at busier ones.
