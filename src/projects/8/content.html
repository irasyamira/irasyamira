This entry is still in the works, come back when it's done!
<!-- Currently as a Senior Product Development Engineer in AMD, I am responsible to provide automation and scripting
solutions for the Electrical Validation team. This includes automating processes across
different hardware and software platforms as well as analyzing current processes to best optimize it and ensure
they are future-proof. I work mostly with Python.
I have the responsibility to ensure every FPGA is up to specifications through specially curated test contents.
I work with Verilog designs via Quartus II as well as plenty of C/Python/tcl scripting for automation works.
<br>
<br>
During my undergrad years as a Computer Systems Engineering student in the University of Auckland,
I have been exposed to various programming languages for both software and embedded systems development.
I have worked with FPGAs (cyclone, arria) for projects such as game development for Compsys305 as well
as image/video processing for Compsys701.
I was also exposed to web application development using Python and CherryPy for Compsys302,
and further explored on this branch of webdev when I started working on this website.
During my final year project, I picked up some basics to machine learning as well as some
Android mobile application development using Android studio.
<br>
<br>
While I am still in my early years of my career life, I am continuously taking on side projects
in my free time to explore my interests and sharpen my skills.
Like most developers, I too am guilty of having countless of Github repositories with the first
commit being the last one in a very long time.
But I am proud I did finish this website!
